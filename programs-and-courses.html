					<h3 class="">"RAIN LAB" - REFLECT, ACT, INNOVATE AND NURTURE.</h3>
					<p>Rain lab was inaugurated by Prof. Dr. Sten Ekman; PhD in Innovation Science and Management from Malardalen University in Sweden and Dr. Analill Ekman, Department of Education, Uppsala University in Sweden. Both of them are practicing experts in the area of Innovation led Entrepreneurship. It was inaugurated in the month of February 2012 during their visit to iFEEL in India.</p>
					<p>Both of them mentor and closely work with iFEEL on Innovation and its relevance in all spheres of management.</p>
					<div class="seperator35"></div>
					<h3>THE OBJECTIVE</h3>
					<p>The objective of having the rain lab in the vicinity of the campus is not only to provide the students with a space where they can explore their creative minds and work on the plethora of ideas that may range from whacky to wonderful but also to give them a space where they can prototype a service or a product and implement things and hopefully come out with something sustainable and scalable. We want to give them an environment which has scientifically proven to facilitate innovation.</p>
					<div class="seperator35"></div>
					<h3>THE BENEFITS : B-SCHOOLS</h3>
					<p>Today, the entire world is talking about innovation and the impact that it can have on a business. "Facebook" is a classic example of Innovation in social media. Apple, Google, Tata Nano are all classic examples of businesses soaring up on strengths of innovation. A one rupee shampoo sachet was a classic example of marketing innovation.</p>
					<p>There were times, when cost of a product determined the sales and ultimately the profitability of the business. Cheaper the cost, higher was the sales. Then "Quality" was the differentiator. That is when Japanese companies like Toyota, Sony, Honda etc became world famous.</p>
					<p>Now, when almost all companies are equally competitive in pricing and good in quality, we believe that "innovation" would be the major differentiation going forward. Companies will either have to innovate or die. An iFEEL student would thus be benefitted by being able to adapt to innovation better or implement innovation in his or her area of work than their counterparts from other b-schools.</p>
					<div class="seperator35"></div>
					<h3>LEARNING OUT COME EXPE CTED</h3>
					<p>Innovation is not a function of management like Marketing, Finance, Operations etc. but it is a fruit of creative thinking and creativity emerges from everything and anything and thus it is related to all the functions of management.</p>
					<p>The students are encouraged and guided to work on their ideas and to come up with an innovative process or product along with strategies that are feasible enough to create sales. Thus, students get to learn the different functions of marketing like finance, operations, marketing etc, by incorporating the knowledge with innovation. Hence, they get to channelize their creativity and apply their laws of management at the same time.</p>
					<p>A typical 'rain lab' project would make a student learn the process of innovation by actually having to innovate on a thought or an idea. The project will also give them an entrepreneurial experience as they would have to make a profitable business out of their idea. Thus, they would get the practical experience of the various functions of management and understand the finer nuances of the same and the close proximity that the functions have to each other.</p>
					<p>The entire experience will take the students on an entrepreneurial curve that will make them understand the challenges of the startup ventures. This will test their true potential as innovators, entrepreneurs and leaders.</p>

					<p>iFEEL has the philosophy of deciphering knowledge by focusing on the creation of a true learning environment for the students. In order to achieve this, the Institute encourages the use of a wide range of pedagogical methods and strongly emphasizes experimentation for further innovation. Case  tudies, role-plays, participant presentation, use of computer software, simulation and games, lecture-cum-discussions are among the teaching methods commonly used. Individual and team learning is equally emphasized.</p>
					<div class="seperator35"></div>
					<p>Equal importance is assigned to conventional classroom learning and field research. Students are encouraged to carry out projects in their course, based on fieldwork and/or computerized databases. Industrial visits help the students to experience and appreciate live industrial problems.</p>
					<div class="seperator35"></div>
					<p>This multi-disciplinary approach helps in the creation of knowledge pool and all round development to produce result oriented managers. A variety of seminars are organized by students and faculty members during the academic session. There is a strong belief that true management education goes beyond the boundaries of classrooms.</p>
					<div class="seperator35"></div>
					<p>Broadly the Learning system has 3 Layers</p>
					<p>1. Academic: The academic layer provides the conceptual base required across various subjects.</p>
					<p>2. Professional: The professional layer applies practical skills and industry experience.</p>
					<p>3. Personal: The personal layer provides coaching and mentoring to every student individually.</p>
